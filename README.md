# Abstract:
The impact of social networks on mental health awareness has become increasingly significant as technology has become more integrated into our society. It is now crucial to understand the factors that build engagement with mental health-related content. Factors include post length, post sentiment, hashtags, and chosen platform. Carefully analyzing which factors are the most influential can help people create meaningful posts with high engagement rates to help raise awareness on mental health. Using regression and classifying models, we categorize posts into high, medium, and low engagement levels, and aim to predict engagement rates based on the aforementioned factors. The most effective models from our experiments are the Random Forest and XGBoost models, which identified positive sentiment and specific hashtags to be the most influential. These insights provide us with recommendations on how to create content that is efficient in reaching people and raising awareness of mental health.
